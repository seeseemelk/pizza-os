# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### How do I get set up? ###
Compilation requires the `i386-elf-gcc` cross-compiler and compatible binutils.

In order to compile run the following commands in the project root:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
It will now compile the kernel.
